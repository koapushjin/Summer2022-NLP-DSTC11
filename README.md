# Intent Induction from Conversations for Task-Oriented Dialogue

This repository presents an archive of our summer research in the field of Natural Language Processing funded by Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund. We researched into the topic of *Intent Induction from Conversations for Task-Oriented Dialogue*, [DSTC11](https://dstc11.dstc.community/home)'s summer track (2) proposed by Amazon Alexa AI. I mainly participated in *Task 1 - Intent Clustering* during Summer 2022.
